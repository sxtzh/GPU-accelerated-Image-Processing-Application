## Guidance for Progressing Through Tasks:

    Start Small: Begin with the beginner tasks and ensure you understand each concept thoroughly before moving on.
    Use Resources: For each task, especially as they get more complex, don't hesitate to use online tutorials, documentation, and community forums for guidance.
    Experiment: Once you're comfortable with a task, try extending it or adding your own features to deepen your understanding.
    Review and Refactor: Periodically review your code for previous tasks and see if you can refactor it for better efficiency or readability based on new things you've learned.

## Refreshing C++ Skills
### Beginner Level:
    Task 1: Write a program to manipulate arrays and strings. Focus on basic operations like sorting, searching, reversing, and basic string operations.
    Task 2: Implement a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. This will help you get familiar with functions, conditionals, and loops in C++.
### Intermediate Level:

    Task 3: Create a class for a Book that includes properties like title, author, and price and methods for setting and getting these values. This will get you comfortable with classes and object-oriented programming in C++.
    Task 4: Develop a command-line to-do list where you can add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them. This project will introduce you to more complex data structures like lists and maps.

### Advanced Level:

    Task 5: Build a simple memory management tool that mimics the functionality of new and delete for dynamic memory allocation. This will deepen your understanding of pointers, memory allocation, and constructors/destructors.

## Image-Related Domains Tasks

### Beginner Level:

    Task 1: Load and display an image using OpenCV in C++. This task will introduce you to OpenCV and basic image handling.
    Task 2: Implement basic image processing functions like converting an image to grayscale, binary thresholding, and applying simple filters (e.g., Gaussian blur).

### Intermediate Level:

    Task 3: Write a program to detect edges in an image using the Canny edge detector provided by OpenCV. This will introduce you to more advanced image processing techniques.
    Task 4: Create a small application that can perform face detection in images or real-time video feeds using OpenCV's pre-trained classifiers.

### Advanced Level:

    Task 5: Develop a feature matching application that identifies similar objects in two different images using techniques like SIFT/SURF descriptors and FLANN matching.

## Computer Graphics and Visualization Tasks

### Beginner Level:

    Task 1: Using OpenGL and C++, render a 2D shape (e.g., triangle, rectangle). Focus on understanding the OpenGL pipeline, shaders, and coordinate systems.
    Task 2: Animate the 2D shape created in Task 1, such as changing its color over time or moving it across the screen.

### Intermediate Level:

    Task 3: Render a simple 3D object (e.g., cube, sphere) using OpenGL. This will require understanding of 3D transformations and perspective projection.
    Task 4: Implement basic lighting and shading effects on the 3D object to get a feel for how lighting works in graphics.

### Advanced Level:

    Task 5: Develop a small scene with multiple 3D objects, textures, and implement a simple camera control to navigate through the scene.


By progressing through these tasks, you'll gradually build a strong foundation in both C++ and the specific domains of image processing and computer graphics, setting you up for more advanced projects and applications.
